# Dotfiles

These are my dotfiles. Use them however you see fit.

I am currently running i3 on Manjaro Linux.

## Software used

* Nitrogen
* PCManFM
* Ranger
* Open Broadcaster Software
* Polybar
* ALSA/PulseAudio
* Pianobar
* SpeedCrunch
* Termite
* Zeal
* Compton

## To-do

### General
* pianobar controller (with Polybar integration)
* custom time provider for Polybar with dynamic icon
* Atom/vim/spacemacs keybinds
  - Also [here](https://github.com/HactarCE/alt-vim-keys)
* Better keybinds for caps lock and keyboard layout switching
  - Maybe also run a `notify-send` when the layout changes?
* Configure Dunst and add files
* Sort and add links to "Software used" list
* eog alternates?
* Figure out what I'm doing with xfce4 (add more config files?)

### Needs cleanup
